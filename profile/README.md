ðŸ‘‹ Hello - we are the Theaceae Collective, a small organization that creates things :)

## Mission
In the collective, we attract hobbyists who wish to provide for the community they're in. When everything is in one place, it's easy to find software, and it's easy to help each other.

## Join us
If you're a programmer and you're creating software for the communities you love, you can join the organization and transfer your repositories here.
